#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of designing, developing and maintaining software.
Engineers develop cutting-edge applications, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and virtual reality, increasingly making software engineering important to society.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The introduction of high-level programming languages, such as Fortran and C, enabled developers to write code in a more human-readable form.
The development of integrated development environments (IDEs) further enhanced productivity by providing a comprehensive set of tools for coding, debugging, and testing.
The rise of object-oriented programming (OOP) brought about a paradigm shift in software development, allowing for modular and reusable code.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements & Analysis- Business analysts gather requirements from their customers, target market, and industry experts to create a Business Specification (BS) document which outlines current main points that developers should strive to eliminate through the power of software. 
Project Planning- The projects planned by the development team focuses on building new software products or improving the available one.
Design- Developers will come up with ideas and present a design of the product and they may present more than one design approach, and these ideas are documented in a Design Document Specification (DDS).
Coding & Implementation- Developers use various tools and programming languages to build the code. These are selected based on the demands of the software being developed.
Testing- This is where the development team conducts software testing to find errors and deficiencies. 
Deployment- Engineers will install the software at a company and help individual customers run the application on their computers.
Maintenance- The development teams may choose to first release the product to a smaller population of customers. This can offer insight into how the product is performing and the development teams can make any last adjustments prior to its final release. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile is an iterative and incremental project management approach emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It originated from the software development industry but has since been adopted across various domains.In Agile, projects are broken down into smaller, manageable iterations called sprints. Each sprint typically lasts between 1 and 4 weeks and focuses on delivering specific features or functionalities. The Agile approach encourages collaboration between cross-functional teams, including developers, designers, and business stakeholders. Regular feedback and adaptation are integral to the Agile process, allowing teams to respond quickly to changing requirements and market conditions.		
Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach to project management, where progress flows steadily downwards through distinct phases.In Waterfall, projects are divided into separate phases: requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Each phase must be completed before proceeding to the next, and there is limited flexibility for revisiting previous stages. The Waterfall approach assumes that requirements are well-defined and stable from the outset and that the project can be delivered within the planned timeline and budget.		
Scenarios for Agile:
-Software development projects with evolving requirements and a need for frequent customer feedback.
-Projects where the end goal is unclear and requires exploration and iteration.
-Environments where quick time to market and early value delivery are critical.
-Teams that are cross-functional, self-organizing, and thrive on collaboration and adaptability.
Scenarios for Waterfall:
-Construction or engineering projects with well-defined specifications and minimal changes expected.
-Projects with strict regulatory or compliance requirements that demand extensive documentation.
-Situations where the customer or stakeholders prefer a sequential, predictable approach.
-Organizations with established processes and a culture that values structure and hierarchy.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

-A Software Developer uses their programming skills to create software. They follow the guidelines established by the product owner. They are also responsible for creating proper software documentation, and developing updates and upgrades, and resolving issues for existing software.
-A Quality Assurance engineer identifies bugs, system flaws, and other software issues in your product before it is released to the public. They also confirm that your products or services meet company and industry standards. Other duties include overseeing product problem resolutions, running software compatibility tests, and driving product improvements. 
-A Project Manager supervises the development process and its market entry. To accomplish this, product managers generate ideas for market entry, manage pricing policy, plan and control tasks, and set goals and metrics to achieve the company's objectives and targets. They're involved in analyzing industry, market, and competitor trends to ensure the product's competitiveness. They Closely collaborate with software developers and tech leads, team leaders, marketing specialists, sales representatives, the C-suite, and stakeholders.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

-Integrated Development Environmnents assists developers in developing functional software and applications with ease and comparative finesse, integrating all development tasks in one software application.
An example is Eclipse: Eclipse is one of the most popular IDEs used in the software development industry. It is widely used for Java application development. Besides Java, it supports languages like C, C++, Python, PHP as well. It provides support for code completion, debugging, code inspection, and many other features that facilitate the development process.
-Version Control Systems tracks changes to a file or set of files over time so that you do not have to manage file versions manually or with custom automation scripts.
An example is Mercurial: Mercurial is a free, distributed version control system that launched in 2005. It is considered simpler and easier for beginners to use than more complex systems, like Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

-Security
With the rate of security breaches and cyber threats consistently on the rise, it's important for software development teams and web applications to remain alert. They need to ensure that each layer of software applications is safeguarded. While engineering leaders and software engineers are continuously exploring methods to protect data, vulnerabilities and human errors can still occur.
Strategy: Prioritizing Security at Every Level
To effectively safeguard data and applications, it's essential to adhere to the best practices such as utilizing secure programming languages and analyzing new technologies rigorously before incorporating them into your software.
-Inadequate Scalability Planning
As businesses grow and evolve, so does the number of users and the amount of data they generate. Many software development teams don't anticipate the growth and future demands their software might face. When user volume increases, performance issues may arise and the software might not function as efficiently as required. Failing to build with scalability in mind can be costly and affect user satisfaction or even loss of business.
-Strategy: Prioritize Scalability
Product scalability should be considered at the inception of the project. It is instrumental to the project's success because it ensures the system can handle increased demand and workload without compromising performance, functionality, or product quality. By leveraging cloud-based solutions and architectures, teams can build systems that can grow with demand.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

-Unit testing is a software testing type in which individual units/components are tested in isolation from the rest of the system to ensure that they work as intended. Developers use it to check the correctness of their code and ensure that it meets the requirements and specifications.
-Integration testing is a testing type in which different modules or components of a software application are tested together as a group to ensure that they work as intended and are integrated correctly. The main aim of integration tests is to identify issues that might come up when multiple components work together. It ensures that individual code units/ pieces can work as a whole cohesively.
-System testing is a testing type that tests the entire software application as a whole and ensures that the software meets its functional and non-functional requirements. Testers evaluate the software applicationâ€™s behavior in various scenarios and under different conditions, including normal and abnormal usage to ensure that it can handle different situations effectively.
-Acceptance Testing verifies whether a software application meets the specified acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment. Testing is performed by stakeholders to ensure the alignment of business/functional requirements with the organizationâ€™s objectives.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of giving instructions to a generative AI to produce requested results.
Prompt engineers identify scripts and templates users can customize and complete to receive the best results from the language models. These engineers conduct experiments using diverse inputs to construct a prompt library that application developers can utilize in different situations.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

"Tell me about cybersecurity."
Improved Prompt:
"Describe the primary types of cybersecurity threats faced by businesses today, and outline effective strategies for protecting against these threats."
The improved prompt is more effective because it narrows the focus to specific elements of cybersecurity: types of threats and protective strategies. This specificity helps to guide the response towards actionable information that is directly relevant to current business needs. The original prompt is too broad and could result in a general overview that may not address the specific concerns or interests of the person asking. By clarifying what information is needed, the improved prompt ensures that the response is both targeted and useful.
